# Motivation & Concepts

## Basic Idea

## Routing

## Shell

## Application

## Controller and Components













To integrate Nalu into your project, the following steps need to be done:

* for GWT 2.x:
1. Add needed library to your project or add a Maven dependency
2. Modify ythe module Descriptor (*.gwt.xml)
3. Set up the entry point
4. Create application-, controller- und component-classes

* for GWT 3.0:

***Once GWT 3 / J2Cl is available, we will update this section.***

## Dependencies
Nalu has dependencies to the following projects:
* JavaPoet ([Download here](https://github.com/square/javapoet/releases))
* gwt-events  ([Download here](https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt-events))

### Maven Dependency
Add the maven dependency:
```XML
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.nalukit</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.nalukit</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu-processor</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
```
Depending on the widget library the project is using, you have to add a plugin.
In case the project is using a widget library based on elemental 2 or elemento or the project is using a library like [Domino-UI](https://github.com/DominoKit/domino-ui), add the following plguin to your pom:
```XML
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.nalukit</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu-plugin-elemental2</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
```
In case the project is based on GWT widgets, add the following plugin to your pom:
```XML
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.nalukit</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu-plugin-gwt</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.nalukit</groupId>
      <artifactId>nalu-plugin-gwt-processor</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
```

*Nalu is available on Maven central.*

### Requirements
Nalu requires Java 8 and GWT 2.8.x. We recommand to always use the latest GWT 2 version.

### Using with GWT 2
#### GWT configuration file
##### Add dependecies
Insert the Nalu module into your project:
```
  <inherits name='com.github.nalukit.nalu.Nalu'/>
```
Depending on the plugin the project is using, add:
```XML
  <inherits name='com.github.nalukit.nalu.plugin.elemental2.NaluPluginElemental2'/>
```
in case the project is using a elemental 2 or Elemnto based Widget library.

In case the project is using a GWT based widget library, add:
```XML
  <inherits name='com.github.nalukit.nalu.plugin.gwt.NaluPluginGWT'/>
```

#### Set an entry point
```
  <entrypoint class='[path to your entrypoint]'/>
````

### Implement Entrypoint
To implement Nalu in your application, first create an application interface:
```
@Application(shell = Shell.class,
             loader = MyLoader.class,
             startRoute = "/search",
             context = MyApplicationContext.class)
interface MyApplication
    extends IsApplication {
}
```
The application interface must extends ```IsApplication```and needs the ```@Application``` annotation.
The shell-, start- and context- attribute of the @Application annotation is required, where as the loader-attribute is optional.
([more informations about the context](https://github.com/mvp4g/nalu-parent/wiki/04.-Applicaiton-Context))
([more informations about Nalu application loader](https://github.com/mvp4g/nalu-parent/wiki/03.-Application-Loader)).

Create the application EntryPoint:
```
public class Application
    implements EntryPoint {

  public void onModuleLoad() {
    // Create the application.
    // The ApplicationImpl-class
    // will be generated by the framework.
    MyApplication application = new MyApplicationImpl();
    // start the application by calling the run()-method.
    application.run(new NaluPluginGWT());
  }
}
```
The MyApplicationImpl-class will be generated by the annotation processor and is available once a build is done. The run-method requires as parameter the instance of the plugin the project is using.

## Controller, Components, Handlers ...
Now that you have configured your project to use Nalu, you can look at the rest of the documentation to create the different elements you need.
