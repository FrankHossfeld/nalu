# Welcome to the Nalu wiki!

Here you will find a lot of useful information about Nalu.

If you have any questions regarding the framework, please use the [Nalu Gitter room](https://gitter.im/NaluKit42/lobby).

The current version of Nalu uses Java 8 and is tested with the latest GWT version. Nalu is also tested with Java 9, 10, and 11.

## Nalu Project Generator
To start using Nalu is quite easy. Just create a new project [here](http://www.mvp4g.org/gwt-boot-starter-nalu/GwtBootStarterNalu.html).

Press the generate-button, unzip the downloaded file and import it to your preferred IDE.

### Examples

A DiminoDo demo application based on Nalu & Domino-UI is online and can be found [here](http://www.mvp4g.org/dominodo).
