 # Application
To create a Nalu application it is necessary to create an interface that extends IsApplication first. This interface needs the ```@Application```-annotation. (The ```@Application```-annotation can only be used on interfaces which extends ```IsApplication```.)

The attributes of the annotation are:

* **shell**: the shell is the base view of the application and will be automatically added to the viewport of the browser (using the ```attachShell```-method of the shell class.
* **loader**: the application loader will be executed at application start. (see: [Application Loader](https://github.com/mvp4g/nalu-parent/wiki/03.-Application-Loader). This attribute is optinal.
* **startRoute**: The start route is the initial route that is called in case the application is called without a bookmark. If the application is called with a bookmark, the startRoute-attribute has no effect.
* **context**: the application context is a singleton that will be injected in every filter, controller and handler of the application (see: [Context](https://github.com/mvp4g/nalu-parent/wiki/03.-Application-Context)).

This is an example of an application class:

```Java
@Application(shell = Shell.class,
             loader = MyApplicationLoader.class,
             startRoute = "/search",
             context = MyApplicationContext.class)
interface MyApplication
    extends IsApplication {
}
```


## Shell

The application shell is the root view of the application. See [07.Shell](https://github.com/mvp4g/nalu/wiki/07.-Shell) for more informations.

The Nalu GWT plugin provides two more base components. Besides the ```Ã€bstractShell```-
class, there are two more base classes:

* **AbstractCompisteShell**: Base shell class, that extends ```Compiste```
* **AbstractResizeCompositeShell**: Base shell class, that extends ```ResizeCompiste```

If there is a need to attach handlers to DOM elements, you have to override the ```bind```-method.

Depending on the plugin you are using, you have to tell Nalu the extension points in different ways.

### Nalu Elemental2 plugin
In case the **nalu-plugin-elemental2** is used, Nalu uses the id to look for nodes inside the dom.

An implementation using the nalu-plugin-elemental2 looks like this:

```Java
public class Shell
    extends AbstractShell<MyApplicationContext> {

  public Shell() {
  }

  @Override
  public void attachShell() {
    document.body.appendChild(this.render());
  }

  private HTMLElement render() {
    document.body.style.margin = CSSProperties.MarginUnionType.of(0);

    return div().css("shell")
                .add(createNorth())
                .add(createSouth())
                .add(div().css("navigation")
                          .attr(Nalu.NALU_ID_ATTRIBUTE,
                                "navigation")
                          .asElement())
                .add(div().css("shellContent")
                          .attr(Nalu.NALU_ID_ATTRIBUTE,
                                "content")
                          .asElement())
                .asElement();
  }

  private Element createNorth() {
    return header().css("header")
                   .attr(Nalu.NALU_ID_ATTRIBUTE,
                         "header")
                   .asElement();
  }

  private Element createSouth() {
    return footer().css("footer")
                   .attr(Nalu.NALU_ID_ATTRIBUTE,
                         "footer")
                   .asElement();
  }
}
```


### Nalu GWT plugin
In case the **nalu-plugin-gwt** is used, Nalu uses the ```add```-method to add a widget to an panel. The code for the add is generated via a processor. Therefore it is necessary to have package protected instance variables which are annotated with ```@Selector("[name of the selector]")```. The processor will geenrate the code to attach a widget.

**Important: you need to create a provider in your source.**

To do so, implement these two lines inside the ```bind```-method:

```Java
    IsSelectorProvider<Shell> provider = new ShellSelectorProviderImpl();
    provider.initialize(this);
```

Here is an example of a Shell implementation using the nalu-plugin-gwt:
```Java
public class Shell
  extends AbstractShell<MyApplicationContext> {

  private SimpleLayoutPanel headerWidget;
  private ResizeLayoutPanel footerWidget;
  private SimpleLayoutPanel navigationWidget;
  private SimpleLayoutPanel contentWidget;
  private ResizeLayoutPanel shell;
  private ApplicationCss    style;

  public Shell() {
    super();
  }

  @Override
  public void attachShell() {
    RootLayoutPanel.get()
                   .add(this.render());
  }

  private Widget render() {
    this.style = ApplicationStyleFactory.get()
                                        .getStyle();

    shell = new ResizeLayoutPanel();
    shell.setSize("100%",
                  "100%");
    //shell.addResizeHandler(event -> forceLayout());

    DockLayoutPanel panel = new DockLayoutPanel(Style.Unit.PX);
    panel.setSize("100%",
                  "100%");
    shell.add(panel);

    this.headerWidget = createNorth();
    panel.addNorth(this.headerWidget,
                   128);

    this.footerWidget = createSouth();
    panel.addSouth(this.footerWidget,
                   42);

    this.navigationWidget = createNavigation();
    panel.addWest(this.navigationWidget,
                  212);

    this.contentWidget = createContent();
    panel.add(this.contentWidget);

    return panel;
  }

  private SimpleLayoutPanel createNorth() {
    SimpleLayoutPanel panel = new SimpleLayoutPanel();
    panel.addStyleName(style.headerPanel());
    panel.getElement()
         .setId("header");
    return panel;
  }

  private ResizeLayoutPanel createSouth() {
    ResizeLayoutPanel footerPanel = new ResizeLayoutPanel();
    footerPanel.getElement()
               .setId("footer");
    return footerPanel;
  }

  private SimpleLayoutPanel createNavigation() {
    SimpleLayoutPanel panel = new SimpleLayoutPanel();
    panel.addStyleName(style.navigationPanel());
    panel.getElement()
         .setId("navigation");
    return panel;
  }

  private SimpleLayoutPanel createContent() {
    SimpleLayoutPanel panel = new SimpleLayoutPanel();
    panel.getElement()
         .setId("content");
    return panel;
  }

  @Override
  public void bind() {
    IsSelectorProvider<Shell> provider = new ShellSelectorProviderImpl();
    provider.initialize(this);
  }

  @Selector("header")
  public void setHeader(Widget widget) {
    this.headerWidget.clear();
    this.headerWidget.add(widget);
  }

  @Selector("footer")
  public void setFooter(Widget widget) {
    this.footerWidget.clear();
    this.footerWidget.add(widget);
  }

  @Selector("navigation")
  public void setNavigation(Widget widget) {
    this.navigationWidget.clear();
    this.navigationWidget.add(widget);
  }

  @Selector("content")
  public void setContent(Widget widget) {
    this.contentWidget.clear();
    this.contentWidget.add(widget);
  }
}
```

### Post Attach
Nalu will call the ```onAttachedComponent```-method after a new component is attached. If you need to do something after a new component is attached to the dom, this is good place to do so. F.e.: in case you are using GXT and want to do a ```forceLayout``` after a component is attached, use the following code:

```Java
  @Override
  public void onAttachedComponent() {
    this.shell.forceLayout();
  }
```


## Start Route
The start route is the route, that will be used in case the application is called without a bookmark.


## Filter Annotation
Nalu allows you to use filters to stop routings in order to interrupt a route before it is handlled and redirect to another route.

To create a filter, add the ```@Filter````-annotation to the application interface.

Nalu supports the use of more than one filter.

### Creating Filters
To create a filter, you need to:

1. implement the ```IsFilter```-interface
2. override the ```filter```-method: this method will allow to stop a routing or not. If filterEvent method returns false, then the route is stopped, otherwise, it is forwarded to the router.
3. override the ```redirect```-method: In case the routing is stopped, the route return by the method will be routed.
4. override the ```parameters```-method: the parameters of the route. In case ther are no parameters, return ```String[]{}```.

Nalu will inject the context into a filter.

### Adding Filters
Once you have created a filter, you need to tell Nalu to use it. This will be done thanks to the ```@Filters```-annotation that annotates your application interface.

```Java
@Filters(filterClasses = MyFilter.class)
```

**The @Filters annotation will only be handle if the interface is also annotated with @Application!**

The annotation @Filters has the following attributes:

* **filterClasses**: set one or several filters to use. An instance will be created for each class specified.


## Debug Annotation
Nalu integrates a log feature that let you trace the routes handled and controllers used.

To activate the log feature, you need to annotate your application class with @Debug:
```Java
@Debug()
interface MyApplication
    extends IsApplication {
}
```

**The @Debug annotation will only be handle if the interface is also annotated with @Application!**

```@Debug```-annotation has the following attributes:

* **logLevel** (optional, default: SIMPLE): define the level of log:
    * SIMPLE (minimal logging)
    * DETAILED (more detailed logging)
* **logger**: define the class of the logger to use depending on the selected plugin

Every plugin provides a default logger. In case you do not want to create a own logger, use:

* **gwt-plugin-elemental2**: ```DefaultElemental2Logger```.class
* **gwt-plguin-gwt**: ```DefaultGWTLogger```.class
