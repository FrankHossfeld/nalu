# Application Context
The application context is a class, which will be instantiated by the framework and injected in every controller, filter and handler. All controllers, handlers, filters and the loader will have access to the same instance.

This is a good place to store informations about the application.

The context is a required attribute of the ```Application```-annotation.

```Java
@Application(shell = Shell.class,
             loader = MyLoader.class,
             startRoute = "/search",
             context = MyApplicationContext.class)
interface MyApplication
    extends IsApplication {
}
```
