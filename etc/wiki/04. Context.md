# Application Context
The application context is a singleton that is injected in every controller, filter and handler. This is a good place to store informations about the application. The context is a required attribute of the ```Application```-annotation.

```Java
@Application(shell = Shell.class,
             loader = MyLoader.class,
             startRoute = "/search",
             context = MyApplicationContext.class)
interface MyApplication
    extends IsApplication {
}
```
