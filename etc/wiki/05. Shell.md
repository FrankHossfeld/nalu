# Shell
In Nalu the shell represents the base layout of an application and has to be attached to the viewport.

Let's look at a basis web application layout:

![Basic application layout](https://github.com/mvp4g/nalu-parent/tree/master/etc/images/ApplicationLayout.png)

The example of a basic web application layout is devided into four view areas:

* header area

* footer area

* navigation area

* content area


Depending on the Nalu plugin the project is using each area has

* an unique id (in case of using the Nalu-Plugin-Elemental2)

or

* a widget annotation (in case of using the Nalu-Plugin-GWT)

to identify the area. The name of the identifier can be used as **selectors** inside Nalu, to add a component.
