# Application
To create a Nalu application it is necessary to create an interface that extends IsApplication frist. This interface needs the ```@Application```-annotation.

The ```@Application```-annotation can only be used on interfaces that extend ```IsApplication```.
The attributes of the annotation are:

* shell: the shell is the base view of the application and will be automatically added to the viewport of the browser (using the ```attach```-method of the shell class.
* loader: the application loader will be executed at application start. (see: [Application Loader](https://github.com/mvp4g/nalu-parent/wiki/03.-Application-Loader). This attribute is optinal.
* startRoute: The start route is the initial route that is called in case the application is called without a bookmark. If the application is called with a bookmark, the startRoute-attribute has no effect.
* context: the application context is a singleton that will be injected in every filter, controller and handler of the application (see: [Context](https://github.com/mvp4g/nalu-parent/wiki/03.-Application-Context)).

This is an example of an application class:

```Java
@Application(shell = Shell.class,
             loader = MyApplicationLoader.class,
             startRoute = "/search",
             context = MyApplicationContext.class)
interface MyApplication
    extends IsApplication {
}
```

## Shell

The application shell is a class that extends ```AbstractShell```. AbstractShell needs the class name of the application context as generic parameter. Inside the application shell define the layout of the viewport. The Shell needs to implement the ```attach```-method. Inside the ```attach```-method contains the code where the shell is added to the browser. This code depends on the widget library the project is using, so it must be implement by the application.

If there is a need to attach handlers to DOM elements, you have to override the ```bind```-mehtod.

Nalu uses id of DOM elements to add elements to the DOM. Depending on the plugin the application is using, use the ```@Selector```-annotation (in case you are using the Nalu-Plugin-GWT) or set the ```id```-attribute of the DOM elements which will be used to append childs.

Here is an example of a Shell implementation using the Nalu-Plugin-GWT:
```Java
public class Shell
    extends AbstractShell<MyApplicationContext> {

  private ResizeLayoutPanel shell;
  private ApplicationCss style;

  @Selector("header")
  SimpleLayoutPanel headerWidget;

  @Selector("footer")
  ResizeLayoutPanel footerWidget;

  @Selector("navigation")
  SimpleLayoutPanel navigationWidget;

  @Selector("content")
  SimpleLayoutPanel contentWidget;

  public Shell() {
    super();
  }

  /**
   * The ShellPresenter has to implemented this method, because the framework
   * can not do this. (It does not know, what to use).
   * <p>
   * We append the ShellView to the browser body.
   */
  @Override
  public void attachShell() {
    RootLayoutPanel.get()
                   .add(this.render());
  }

  private Widget render() {
    this.style = ApplicationStyleFactory.get()
                                        .getStyle();

    shell = new ResizeLayoutPanel();
    shell.setSize("100%",
                  "100%");
    //shell.addResizeHandler(event -> forceLayout());

    DockLayoutPanel panel = new DockLayoutPanel(Style.Unit.PX);
    panel.setSize("100%",
                  "100%");
    shell.add(panel);

    this.headerWidget = createNorth();
    panel.addNorth(this.headerWidget,
                   128);

    this.footerWidget = createSouth();
    panel.addSouth(this.footerWidget,
                   42);

    this.navigationWidget = createNavigation();
    panel.addWest(this.navigationWidget,
                  212);

    this.contentWidget = createContent();
    panel.add(this.contentWidget);

    return panel;
  }

  private SimpleLayoutPanel createContent() {
    SimpleLayoutPanel panel = new SimpleLayoutPanel();
    panel.getElement()
         .setId("content");
    return panel;
  }

  private SimpleLayoutPanel createNavigation() {
    SimpleLayoutPanel panel = new SimpleLayoutPanel();
    panel.addStyleName(style.navigationPanel());
    panel.getElement()
         .setId("navigation");
    return panel;
  }

  private SimpleLayoutPanel createNorth() {
    SimpleLayoutPanel panel = new SimpleLayoutPanel();
    panel.addStyleName(style.headerPanel());
    panel.getElement()
         .setId("header");
    return panel;
  }

  private ResizeLayoutPanel createSouth() {
    ResizeLayoutPanel footerPanel = new ResizeLayoutPanel();
    footerPanel.getElement()
               .setId("footer");
    return footerPanel;
  }

  @Override
  public void bind() {
    IsSelectorProvider<Shell> provider = new ShellSelectorProviderImpl();
    provider.initialize(this);
  }
}
```

## Start Route
The start route is the route, that will be used in case the application is called without a bookmark.

## Filter Annotation
Nalu allows you to use filters to stop routings in order to interrupt a route before it is handlled.

### Creating Filters
To create a filter, you need to:

1. implement the ```IsFilter```-interface
2. override the ```filter```-method: this method will allow to stop a routing or not. If filterEvent method returns false, then the route is stopped, otherwise, it is forwarded to the router.
3. override the ```redirect```-method: In case the routing is stopped, the route return by the method will be routed.
4. override the ```parameters```-method: the parameters of the route

The context is injected into each filter.

### Adding Filters
Once you have created a filter, you need to tell Nalu to use it. This will be done thanks to the ```@Filters```-annotation that annotates your application interface.

```Java
@Application(...)
@Filters( filterClasses = OneRouteFilter.class )
interface MyApplication
    extends IsApplication {
}
```

**The @Filters annotation will only be handle if the interface is also annotated with @Application!**

Annotation @Filters has the following attributes:

* filterClasses: set one or several filters to use. An instance will be created for each class specified.

## Debug Annotation
Nalu integrates a log feature that let you trace the routes handled and controllers used.

To activate the log feature, you need to annotate your application class with @Debug:
```Java
@Application(...)
@Debug()
interface MyApplication
    extends IsApplication {
}
```
**The @Debug annotation will only be handle if the interface is also annotated with @Application!**

```@Debug```-annotation has the following attributes:

* logLevel (optional, default: SIMPLE): define the level of log:
    SIMPLE (minimal logging)
    DETAILED (more detailed logging)
* logger: define the class of the logger to use depending on the selected plugin
